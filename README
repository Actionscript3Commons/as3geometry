AS3 Geometry is a place for me to place my geometry classes. Over the years I've created innumerable geometry implementations, and I am looking to create a definitive collection.

Principles:

# Types of objects are defined by interfaces
# Objects have at least one implementation which is immutable; the defining data are unchangable after construction.
# Objects may have another implementation which is mutable. Mutable objects implement the Mutable interface which defines an as3signal. Any mutable object must dispatch the changed signal when any defining data changes.
